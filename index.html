        Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness
        ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East
        Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
        (SARS-CoV).
        <br />
        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain that was discovered in
        2019 and has not been previously identified in humans. Coronaviruses are
        zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.
        Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet
        cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several
        known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet
        infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms,
        fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more
        severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory
        syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

        The details about how many are effected due to theis virus globally is
        given in this link:

        The coronavirus could be detected up to a minimum of 3 hours later in
        the air, up to 4 hours on copper surfaces, up to 24 hours on cardboard
        and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel surfaces. The results
        from this study indicate that the coronavirus can be transmitted through
        aerosols (clusters of the virus in the air) aerosol and fomites (objects
        such as plastic, steel, other metals contaminated with the virus) are
        plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours
        and on surfaces up to days.<br />
        No information was given on fabric in this study, but it is likely that
        the fabric remains contaminated hours after the exposure similar to
        cardboard. Furthermore, no study has been conducted that suggests sun
        exposure as a factor that reduces the virus. Finally, the inability to
        detect the virus (under the detection threshold) is not equivalent to
        the complete elimination of the virus. However, to acquire an infection,
        one needs a minimum threshold or level or viral exposure. Hence, the
        claim on the longevity of 12 hrs is false. The virus remains intact on
        the surface for much longer.

      <p>
        The COVID-19 virus affects different people in different ways. COVID-19
        is a respiratory disease and most infected people will develop mild to
        moderate symptoms and recover without requiring special treatment.
        People who have underlying medical conditions and those over 60 years
        old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and death.<br>
        Common symptoms include:

        <li>Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell</li>
        <li>Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-weight: bolder;">Don't</p>
